EDIT 
The lack of respect of Monero community in less than a day was be able to screwe me to the point that the whole project will be migrated to an alternative Cryptonote based cryptocurrency, no more donation address.
Sorry but the community is important for a cryptocurrency and I don't want to have nothing to do with a bunch of angry troll who spread shit on people that try to give their free contribute in such way.
